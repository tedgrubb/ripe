Hi,

<%= @sender_name %> invited you to beta test a new kind of recipe site called It's Ripe!

It's Ripe is designed to help you discover new recipes based on the ingredients you have.

Here's how it works:

    * Keep track of your ingredients in a virtual pantry.
    * Create grocery lists to help keep your pantry stocked.
    * Get recipe recommendations based on what you've added.
    * Add more ingredients to keep getting better recommendations.
    * You can add your favorite recipes or pick from recipes added by the community.

What can you make?
