  1 Betty Crocker cake mix.  Make and bake according to the recipe on the box.  Bake in a 9 x 13 inch pan.  Cool cake.TOPPING:

 1 small box of lemon pudding (cook according to recipe on the box and cool completely, could be made the night before.  I like the Jello brand).  Spread the cooled pudding on top of the cooled cake.  Then frost with the following frosting: 2 egg whites 1/3 cup water   Put this in a double boiler, cook and beat at high speed for 7 minutes (water should not touch the bottom of the pan while boiling).  Then remove from boiling water and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 3 teaspoons of powdered sugar and beat 2 more minutes.  Cool slightly, spread this on top of the lemon filling.  Then sprinkle 1/2 cup or less of coconut on top.  (This keeps frosting in place.)  I receive many compliments on this cake.
