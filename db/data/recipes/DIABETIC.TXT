 *May use egg substitute or egg whites.  **Nuts may be omitted.  I have substituted the nuts with 1/2 cup mashed bananas for an entirely different flavor, if you do this, mix banana with the wet ingredients.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cook raisins in the water until all water is absorbed, approximately 30 minutes.  Mix all wet ingredients in one bowl and all dry ingredients in a separate bowl.  Add nuts to the flour mixture then add the flour mixture to the liquid mixture.  Fold in the raisins.  Bake in loaf or bundt pan for 35 to 45 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out dry.

1/2 cup undiluted frozen apple juice concentrate
1 1/2 to 2 tsp tapioca, cornstarch or flour
1/2 tsp lemon juice (optional)

  Divide pastry into 2 parts and roll thin to fit an 8 or 9-inch plate.  Set aside.  Mix apples, apple juice concentrate, thickener and spice and stir until apples are well coated.  Add lemon juice, if desired, to keep apples lighter-colored. Taste 1 piece of apple to check the spice.  Pour into the pastry-lined pie pan and top with the second crust or pastry strips.  Seal the edges and cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.  Bake at 425 degrees for 40-45 minutes until golden brown.  Serve warm or cold.  NOTE:  Apples have some natural pectin, but a small amount of thickener seems necessary to hold the sweet concentrate of the apples for an even flavor.
