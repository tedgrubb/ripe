SICILIAN RICOTTA CHEESECAKE

Sponge cake:

Butter
3 egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
Finely chopped rind of 1/2 lemon
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
3 egg whites


Filling:

1-1/2 cup sugar
1-1/2 pound fresh ricotta cheese
1 pound mixed candied fruit
1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
3  1-ounce squares semi-sweet chocolate, chopped in pieces
8 tbsp Maraschino liqueur


To make the sponge cake:

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 10 inch spring-form
cake pan.

Whisk the eggs yolks with the sugar, grated lemon rind and 3
tbsp hot water until light and foamy.

Sift the flour and baking powder together, and fold it into the
egg yolk mixture.

Whisk the egg whites until stiff, but not dry. With a large
spoon, fold them into the cake mixture.

Pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan and bake for 15 to
20 minutes, or until the cake is a rich golden color and springs
back when pressed lightly. Turn out and cool on a wire rack.


For the filling:

Dissolve the sugar in 3 tbsp of water over low heat. Beat the
sugar syrup with the ricotta cheese until it is smoothly
blended. Put aside about half of the best pieces of candied
fruit to decorate the cake. Chop the remainder coarsely.

Add the cinnamon to the sweetened ricotta and beat until smooth
and creamy. Put aside a few tbsp of the mixture for decoration.
Combine the remainder with the chopped fruit and chocolate.

Cut the sponge cake in half horizontally. Put one layer on the
bottom of the cake pan, cut side up, and sprinkle it with half
of the Maraschino. Spread with the remaining cheese mixture. Fit
the ring of the cake pan in position and chill the cake for
several hours.

When ready to serve, remove the cake from the pan and place it
on a large, flat serving dish. Coat the top and sides with the
reserved cheese and decorate with the reserved candied fruit.

You may also decorate the cake with whipped cream, and the
candied fruits may be supplemented with chopped nuts.
