 Light oven.  Get out bowls, spoons, measuring cups and ingredients.  Grease the pan.  Have all the kids in camp crack nuts.  Remove Bernie, Ron, Dick, Joe, and Paul, along with 5 coffee cups, 7 fishing lures, 4 spark plugs and 1 tackle box from the table.  Measure 2 cups of flour.  Hear laughter and go down by the dock in time to see the guys untying Glyn and Don's boat from the dock before they pull the dock out to Center Bar.  Come back and find Ben covered in flour.  Brush Ben off and measure 2 more cups of flour to replace spilled flour.  Add rest of dry ingredients to flour.  Hear kids screaming outside, look out window and see them running after squirrels who have stolen the walnuts.  Rescue kids from squirrels, come back into kitchen and find Danny and David Tietz, along with Steve and Robbi playing a game of Pfeffer at the kitchen table.  Banish them and their cards to the lodge table.  Add eggs.  Phone rings, yell out window for Tonya to come to the phone.  Add shortening.  Betty runs in, says she's got the catch of the day.  Sue wants it weighed because they are having a contest against George and Helen.  Kess wins the contest, his squirrel weighs more than George's Northern.  Add sugar.  Stir all the ingredients together.  Look up just in time to see Koz's wildly served volleyball come crashing through kitchen window, landing in the middle of the cake bowl.  Wash kitchen floor, wash the table, wash the walls, wash the dishes.  Sylvia comes in and suggests Kim, Debbie, Donna, Doris and herself go to pick up cake at Gordy's.

 Makes 3 bundt pan cakes or 15 (1 pound loaves).   With a "Starter" follow these directions.  (A starter is fruit liquid after 30 day processing period.) --DAY  1:  --

 Pour one pint (2 cups or less) starter into a glass wide mouthed gallon jar.  (Sun Tea jar works well.)  Add one large can sliced peaches and juice.  Cut each slice of peach into four pieces.  Add 2 1/2 cups of sugar and stir every day for 10 days.  Cover jar with a saucer and leave sitting out for ten days at room temperature.  DO   NOT  COVER  AIR-TIGHT.  DO  NOT  REFRIGERATE. --DAY  10:--
