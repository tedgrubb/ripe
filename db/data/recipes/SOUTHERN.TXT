 52094 -- HOW  TO  MAKE  A  DELICIOUS  PUNCH



 For convenience in preparing and ease of serving nothing else quite measures up to a punch, and if the punch is made properly, nothing else quite measures up to it in flavor or elegance.  If you taste preference runs to "sours", you'll really thank us for telling you about the Open House Punch; for it is one of the most delicious drinks you'll ever taste; --25  FIVE  OUNCE  DRINKS:--

1 small can (6 ounce) frozen orange juice concentrate
6 ounce fresh lemon juice
2 small cans (total 12 ounce) frozen lemonade concentrate
2 1/4 quarts (total 72 ounce) prechilled 7 Up
2 1/2 cup (total 20 ounce) Southern Comfort

 Mix in punch bowl; add ice cubes or lump of ice.  Garnish with slices of orange and lemon.  Cherries, strawberries, pineapple sticks, optional.  The Open House Punch can be made more tart by using only one can of lemonade instead of two or by adding fresh lemon juice to suit your personal taste.  Another recipe that will please both you and your guests is the Southern Punch.  It is a little stronger in alcoholic content than the Open House Punch.
