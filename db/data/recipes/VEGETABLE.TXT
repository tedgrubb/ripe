Easy to prepare and satisfying for the heartiest appetite!  Serves 4, main course.  Serves 6, first course. 1 lg or 2 small heads cauliflower (about 3 lbs.)
1 tbsp salt

1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly milled black pepper
1/2 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 pound margherita (narrow rippled noodles)
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup chicken broth, heated (see note)
1/2 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
2 tsp minced Italian parsley leaves (garnish)
Freshly grated Romano cheese (for serving)

 1.  Remove florets from cauliflower, including about 1 inch of stem.  Break or cut into 1 inch pieces.  Wash thoroughly in lukewarm water, drain in colander and set aside.  2.  Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil.  Add 1 tablespoon salt and the cauliflower florets.  Boil until barely tender when tested with a fork, about 5 minutes.  With a skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer florets to a colander, rinse under cold water and drain well.  Reserve liquid for cooking pasta.  3.  In a shallow bowl, combine flour, bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper.  Dredge florets in flour mixture, being sure each piece is well coated.  Arrange in a single layer on a large platter.  4.  In a 12 inch skillet, heat 1/2 cup olive oil over medium heat until haze forms.  Add garlic, turn heat to low and saute' until lightly golden, pressing the garlic flat in pan with the back of a wooden spoon.  With a slotted spoon, remove garlic and drain on paper towel; set aside.  (If you are not a garlic lover, discard.)  Place florets in pan and saute' over medium heat, turning with spatula, until golden and crisp on all sides; don't be concerned if florets break apart while frying.  5.  Meanwhile, return water in which cauliflower was cooked to a boil.  Add pasta and cook until al dente; the cauliflower and pasta must be done at the same time so that the florets will still be crispy when tossed with the pasta.  Drain pasta in a large colander, transfer to a bowl containing 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss quickly.  6.  Mix half of the cauliflower and any of the browned fragments stuck to the bottom of the pan with the pasta.  Add sauteed garlic, heated chicken broth and Romano cheese; toss well again.  Spoon remaining cauliflower on top and garnish with minced parsley.  Serve immediately with additional grated Romano cheese.

 998742 -- A  POT  OF  GREENS  -  "SOUTHERN  STYLE"



Fresh collards
Mustard
Turnip greens 

 Or - can use all three of above mixed together.  (Frozen ones taste just like the box.  Don't even fool with them). 1 turnip, soft-ball size
1/2 pound lean side meat
Salt
Pressure-cooker

 Fresh greens are sandy and must be thoroughly washed in several changes of water.  A clean laundry tub works well or you can actually put them in the washer on the delicate cycle, no soap, just a little lemon juice and let them swish around in there, but don't let them spin.  And don't let anybody see you do it.  Pull the green leafy part off the tough stems and tear into pieces with your hands. Discard the stems. You will think that you have enough greens to feed an army when you start, but greens yield about half their weight and also cook down to a smaller amount, like cabbage.  Following your pressure-cooker directions, put them in your cooker with the recommended amount of water - usually a half-cup.  Chicken or beef broth works well too.  Cut the side meat up into 2 x 2 inch chunks and distribute throughout the greens.  Dice the turnip up and sprinkle across the top.  I find that it takes about 15 minutes of pressure to cook them to the proper Southern degree of tenderness.  When the pressure goes down, remove them from the pot and place in a large deep pan.  They should be dark-green and soft, not chewy at all.  DO NOT DRAIN.  Chop the greens and turnips and side-meat all up together.  Sprinkle with salt to taste.  Place in serving dish and serve warm with corn bread to soak up the pot-liquor.

 998817 -- GOLDEN  HAM  &  CHIVE  POTATO  CAKE



Unsalted butter, softened (for the pan)
2 pound boiling potatoes, such as round whites from Maine or Long Island
1 heaping tbsp coarse sea salt
4 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
1 medium onion, finely chopped
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Freshly grated nutmeg to taste 
4 large egg yolks
4 ounce unsmoked salt-cured ham, such as prosciutto, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup fresh chives, snipped with a scissors

 1.  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Coat the bottom and sides of the cake pan with butter.  Set aside.  2.  Peel and rinse the potatoes.  Place in a saucepan, and cover generously with cold water.  Add the salt and cook over moderate heat -- do not boil -- until a skewer inserted in a potato comes away easily, about 20 minutes.  3.  Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, combine 1 tablespoon of the butter and the onions over moderate heat.  Season lightly, and cook until the onions are soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside.  4.  As soon as the potatoes are cooked, drain them well.  Pass them through the fine grid of a food mill into a large mixing bowl.  (If the potatoes are large,  you may want to halve or quarter them before passing through the mill.)  With a wooden spoon, stir in the nutmeg, the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, and the egg yolks, one at a time.  Continue stirring vigorously until the butter and egg yolks are thoroughly incorporated.  The mixture will be thick and slippery.  5.  Fold the onions, ham, and chives into the potato mixture.  Transfer the mixture to the cake pan, and smooth it out with the back of a spoon.  Place it in the center of the oven and bake, uncovered, until the potato cake is firm and the top is browned, 45 to 50 minutes.  6.  Remove the potato cake from the oven and transfer it, browned-side up (for the golden top side is the prettier), to a large platter.  Slice into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.  Yield:  6 to 8 servings.  VARIATION:  For very pretty individual potato cakes, bake these in nonstick muffin tins.

 998829 -- CRISPY  SAUTEED  POTATOES



  I first sampled these potatoes at a lunch in the Poitou region, at the home of  Joel Robuchon's cousin, who raises lambs and goats on a lovely little farm not far from Poitiers.  We lunched on homemade quiche, salad from the garden, a rustic civet (game stew), and these golden potatoes.  At first I thought they'd been deep fried, they tasted so rich and crunchy.  But this method offers terrific flavor and considerably fewer calories.  In this recipe, the potatoes should be peeled, rinsed, quartered, then rinsed again, so that the starch is eliminated; the final rinsing will prevent the potatoes from sticking to the pan.  The ideal fat for cooking potatoes in this manner is goose or duck fat.  Lacking that, use clarified butter.  And be sure not to season the potatoes until they are thoroughly browned, or they will become soggy.  Although the potatoes are cooked in only 1 tablespoon of fat, the resulting flavor is deliciously rich.  Select small potatoes of equal size, so that they will cook quickly and evenly. 1 pound small round red-skinned potatoes
1 tbsp goose fat (or clarified butter)
1 plump fresh garlic clove, minced
Sea salt to taste

 1.  Peel, rinse, and quarter the potatoes.  Rinse again in several changes of cold water, and dry thoroughly with a thick towel.  Set aside.  2.  In a large skillet, heat the fat over moderately high heat.  When hot, add the potatoes and brown thoroughly on one side before tossing to brown another side.  Be patient and resist the urge to intervene.  Cook until the potatoes are thoroughly browned and offer no resistance when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes in all.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more, but do not allow it to burn.  Transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl, season with salt, and serve immediately.   Yield:  4 servings.
